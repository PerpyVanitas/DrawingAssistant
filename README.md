# DrawingAssistant

To use the program, open the program and open MS paint. Once launched, choose an image file and adjust values for the tolerances. Place cursor for where you want to put the drawing. It will begin with the upper left corner of the image. 

Special thanks to Jev (Jian Lev Olamit) for helping me with the process.
